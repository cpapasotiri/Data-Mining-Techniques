# <center>Data Mining Techniques - Projects - Spring Semester 2023</center>
<center>Professor in charge: Γουνόπουλος Δημήτριος</center><br>

## Purpose of the Projects
The purpose of these projects is to familiarize you with the basic stages of the process followed for the application of data mining techniques, namely: preprocessing/cleaning, transformation, application of data mining techniques and evaluation. The implementation will be done in the Python programming language using the tools/libraries: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and SciKit Learn.

## Project 1 Description
Customer Personality Analysis is a comprehensive examination of a company's ideal clientele. It assists a business in better understanding its customers and facilitates the customization of products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of various customer segments. For example, instead of spending money on promoting a new product to every customer in the company's database, a business can analyze which customer category is more likely to purchase the product and then promote the product only to that particular category.

## Project 2 Description
Goodreads is a social platform combined with a book database that bears resemblance to IMDb for movies: users can search for books, tag them, share their thoughts, and engage in discussions. Most importantly, they can rate the books they have read on a scale from 1 to 5 and discover new books to read. Our goal is to analyze a subset of data from this platform and create a program that recommends books. Another aim of this work is to automatically categorize books into genres based on their descriptions. Finally, those interested can utilize the book covers to create a simple image retrieval system based on their content (bonus).
The file you will use is the Best Books Ever Dataset. You can find the file in the Zenodo repository at the following link (where you will also find the button to download it): https://zenodo.org/record/4265096#.Y-N2DnbP1jE.
